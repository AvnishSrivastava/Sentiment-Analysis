# Sentiment Analysis

It is important for companies to understand the sentiments of their customers or clients in order to remain competitive and grow their businesses. Traditionally this depended upon feedback surveys and informal, small-scale and often inefficient methods. Today, however, there is great deal of information on social media and e-commerce platforms related to customer's experinces with products and services. This is available for companies to analyze and better understand their customer's experience and satisfaction.

Accurately identyfing the sentiment in a body of text requires accuracy (to be useful) and automation (to deal with the scale and nautue of data available today). Machine learning models provide one solution to this problem.

Here we have collected reviews for various products and services from different sources written between December 2016 and March 2017.

Build a machine learning model using reviews about companies' products and services that will predict whether reviews are positive or negative.
